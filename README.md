# Dynamic Procurement Agent

 Project Description
The Dynamic Procurement Agent is a disaster‑response system that automates aid procurement using blockchain smart contracts, instant vendor onboarding, and transparent transaction logging. Triggered by disaster alerts, it connects local micro‑vendors to relief agencies, ensuring faster delivery of food, water, medicine, and transport with guaranteed payments and auditable records.

 Problem Statement
Disaster aid is slowed by bureaucracy, corruption, and lack of local vendor access.  
Our agent removes delays with instant, transparent procurement.

 Motivation
Speed saves lives — faster procurement means quicker relief.  
Local vendors gain fair access, building trust and resilience.
